# ADR-0001: Framework Choice

## Context
We must replace the legacy **Flask (Python 2)** application with a modern micro-web framework.  
The legacy stack (Flask + Python 2 + MD5 auth) is outdated, insecure, and does not meet course requirements (OpenAPI, CI/CD pipelines, containerization).

‚ö†Ô∏è Constraints from the course:
- Excluded frameworks: Flask, Express, Spring Boot  
- Should not use full-stack web frameworks like Django, Rails, etc.  
- SQLite will remain the database for the first weeks  
- The focus is DevOps, so the framework should be lightweight and easy to adopt  

**Our new framework must:**
- Be lightweight and easy to adopt  
- Support OpenAPI specification (course requirement)  
- Integrate well with CI/CD pipelines  
- Deploy cleanly to a VM or Azure Web App  
- Use SQLite initially 

---

## Decision
We choose **Go** as our language and runtime, combined with:  
- **gorilla/mux** ‚Üí a lightweight HTTP router (multiplexer) for mapping requests like `GET /login` or `POST /api/register` to handlers  
- **modernc.org/sqlite** ‚Üí a pure-Go SQLite driver (no CGO), which makes Docker builds portable and CI/CD pipelines simpler  
- **gorilla/sessions + bcrypt** ‚Üí for secure authentication and login sessions  
- **html/template + static serving** ‚Üí for server-side rendering with reusable layouts  
- **env-based configuration** ‚Üí via `PORT` and `DATABASE_PATH`  

üìå To lower the learning curve for the team (all beginners in Go), we will **keep route definitions in `main.go`** so it‚Äôs easy to see the application structure.  
Handler logic may later be refactored into separate files, but the route map will remain in `main.go` for clarity.

This choice provides a minimal but flexible foundation: Go offers performance and concurrency, mux handles routing, and modernc/sqlite provides a simple embedded DB layer.

## Considerations

Two team members created early prototypes:  
- **Teammate 1 prototype**: gorilla/mux + mattn/sqlite3 + gorilla/sessions + bcrypt. 
- **Teammate 2 prototype**: gorilla/mux + modernc/sqlite + templates/static + env-config. 

We combined the best parts into our final stack: gorilla/mux for routing, modernc/sqlite for DB portability, gorilla/sessions + bcrypt for auth, and Go templates + static serving for server-side rendering.

### FastAPI (Python 3)
- ‚úÖ Built-in OpenAPI and async support  
- ‚úÖ Strong popularity, great docs  
- ‚úÖ Member has prior experience with framework  
- ‚ùå More setup required for templating (Jinja2)  
- ‚ùå Heavier dependency stack, less minimal than required  
- ‚ùå Anders said no

### Gin (Go)
- ‚úÖ High performance, idiomatic web framework  
- ‚úÖ Good OpenAPI tooling  
- ‚ùå Slightly steeper learning curve  
- ‚ùå More ‚Äúframework-like‚Äù than needed  

### Gorilla/mux (Go) ‚Äî **Chosen**
- ‚úÖ Lightweight and idiomatic router  
- ‚úÖ Easy to read and learn  
- ‚úÖ Pairs cleanly with modernc/sqlite (no CGO)  
- ‚úÖ Flexible: sessions, templates, JSON APIs can be added gradually  
- ‚ùå In maintenance mode, but still widely used and stable  

---

## Consequences

### Pros
- ‚úÖ CI/CD friendly: one statically compiled binary, easy Docker builds  
- ‚úÖ Secure auth: bcrypt + gorilla/sessions instead of MD5  
- ‚úÖ Simple migration path: reuse search logic and templates from Flask while learning Go  
- ‚úÖ Good exam fit: shows modernization (Python 2 ‚Üí Go) and industry-relevant practices  
- ‚úÖ SQLite-first: works with lightweight VM setups and demo data; future-ready for Postgres  
- ‚úÖ Route definitions in `main.go` make it easier for beginners to navigate the codebase  

### Cons / Risks
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Learning curve: team must learn Go idioms and template syntax  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Gorilla/mux is stable but no longer actively developed; long-term, chi or Gin may be better choices  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è OpenAPI requires extra tooling (`go-swagger`, `oapi-codegen`), not built-in like FastAPI  
- ‚ö†Ô∏è If the app grows, `main.go` could become large; we may later refactor routes/handlers into packages
