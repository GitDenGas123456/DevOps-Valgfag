# ADR-0002: Framework Choice

Context

We must replace the legacy Flask (Python 2) application with a modern micro-web framework.
The framework must:
	•	Be lightweight and easy to adopt
	•	Support OpenAPI specification (course requirement)
	•	Work well with CI/CD pipelines
	•	Deploy cleanly to a VM (Azure/DigitalOcean)
	•	Use SQLite initially
